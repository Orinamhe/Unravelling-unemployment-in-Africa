# Unravelling-unemployment-in-Africa
Leveraging Python for Data-Driven Analysis on Unraveling Unemployment in Africa

**Overview**

Unemployment in Africa presents a unique and pressing challenge, as the continent grapples with rapid population growth, limited industrialization, and economic disparities.

Tackling unemployment requires coordinated efforts through several factors. Some key factors are:
Education and skill levels
Infrastructure
Government policies
Economic vitality – health of private sector.

Data cleaning was conducted using Python, with step-by-step code development and detailed documentation carried out in Jupyter Notebook. The analysis was confined to data from the year 2000 onward to ensure that insights were drawn from current unemployment trends and their influencing factors. This approach aimed to enhance the relevance and applicability of the findings

Access to electricity, government’s expenditure on education, country’s private sector and national strategies on youth employment are important factors that reduced unemployment rates in Europe, a region with the highest unemployment rates between 2010 -2015.

Given the unique socio-economic dynamics in Africa, adopting a similar approach might seem futile holistically as only increasing the number of new firms seem to improve unemployment challenges.

However, on country-specific studies in Africa, it becomes evident that increasing access electricity also reduced unemployment rates.

A comprehensive analysis on the quality of education in African countries could provide valuable insights into education as a viable strategy for reducing unemployment in Africa.

Nations should strive to expand electricity access to leverage both direct and indirect benefits on unemployment rates in accordance with their strategies.

Governments should actively encourage the establishment, sustainability, and expansion of businesses to boost business density rates.
Countries should gather and analyze additional data on other potentially influential factors such as economic sectors, access to financing and other government policies to provide more actionable and detailed insights.

**Limitations**

Missing data on factors affecting unemployment in several countries.
